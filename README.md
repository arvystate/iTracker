# iTracker 

A small webpage to display location data sent by mobile devices on a map. The application requires a HTML server with PHP support installed and a single instance of MySQL relational database system. The design is simple and application also features Fullscreen mode and displaying of all data on same map. It can be easily extended with short PHP script to display multiple devices at the same time. Any mobile device with web browser can be used, but a native application is required to provide detailed data from device sensors. The script was tested using **iOS** application called [uTrackMe 2.0](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/utrackme/id301731932?mt=8).
